## Scripted Node (Generator)

aka Script Node or SN. (iteration 1)

- Introduction

- Examples
- Limitations

### Introduction

When you want to express an idea in written form, if the concept is suitable for a one line Python expression then you can use the Formula nodes. They require little setup just [plug and play](). However, they are not intended for multi-line python statements, and sometimes that's exactly what you want.

ScriptNode (SN) allows you to write multi-line python programs, it's possible to use the node as a Sandbox for writing full nodes. The only real limitation will be your Python Skills. It's a prototype so bug reports are welcome.

### Features

allows:
- Loading/Reloading scripts currently in TextEditor
- imports and aliasing, ie anything you can import from console works in SN
- nested functions and lambdas
- named inputs and outputs
- named operators (buttons to action something upon button press)

At present all scripts for SN must (strict list - general): 
- have 1 `sv_main` function as the main workhorse
- `sv_main` must take 1 or more arguments (even if you don't use it)
- all function arguments for `sv_main` must have defaults.
- each script shall define 'in_sockets' and 'out_sockets'
- 'ui_operators' is an optional third output parameter
- TextEditor has automatic `in_sockets` list creation (`Ctrl+I -> Generate in_sockets`) when the key cursor is over `sv_main`.

#### `sv_main()`

`sv_main()` can take int, float and list or nested list. Here are some legal examples:

```python
sv_main(vecs_in_multi=[[]], vecs_in_flat=[], some_var=1, some_ratio=1.2):

[[]]    # for nested
[]      # for float

```

#### `in_sockets`

```python
in_sockets = [
    [type, 'socket name on ui', input_variable],
    [type, 'socket name on ui 2', input_variable2],
    # ...
]
```

#### `out_sockets`

```python
out_sockets = [
    [type, 'socket name on ui', output_variable],
    [type, 'socket name on ui 2', output_variable2],
    # ...
]
```

#### `in_sockets and out_sockets`

- Each `"socket name on ui"` string shall be unique.
- `type` are currently limited to
   - 's' : floats, ints, edges, faces
   - 'v' : vertices, vectors
   - 'm' : matrices

#### `ui_operators`

```python
ui_operators = [
    ['button_name', func1]
] 
```
- Here `func1` is the function you want to call when pressing the button.
- Each `"button_name"` is the text you want to appear on the button. For simplicity it must be unique and a valid variable name. Use alphanumerics only and separate words with single underscores if you need.

#### `return`

Simple, only two flavours are allowed at the moment.
```python
return in_sockets, out_sockets
# or
return in_sockets, out_sockets, ui_operators
```

### Examples

The best way to get familiarity with SN is to go through the templates folder. They are intended to be lightweight and educational, but some of them will show
advanced use cases. The [thread on github](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/issues/85) may also provide some pictorial insights and animations.

Sverchok includes a plugin in TextEditor which conveniently adds `sv NodeScripts` to the Templates menu.

A typical nodescript may look like this:

```python
from math import sin, cos, radians, pi
from mathutils import Vector, Euler


def sv_main(n_petals=8, vp_petal=20, profile_radius=1.3, amp=1.0):

    in_sockets = [
        ['s', 'Num Petals',  n_petals],
        ['s', 'Verts per Petal',  vp_petal],
        ['s', 'Profile Radius', profile_radius],
        ['s', 'Amp',  amp],
    ]

    # variables
    z_float = 0.0
    n_verts = n_petals * vp_petal
    section_angle = 360.0 / n_verts
    position = (2 * (pi / (n_verts / n_petals)))

    # consumables
    Verts = []
    Edges = []

    # makes vertex coordinates
    for i in range(n_verts):
        # difference is a function of the position on the circumference
        difference = amp * cos(i * position)
        arm = profile_radius + difference
        ampline = Vector((arm, 0.0, 0.0))

        rad_angle = radians(section_angle * i)
        myEuler = Euler((0.0, 0.0, rad_angle), 'XYZ')

        # changes the vector in place, successive calls are accumulative
        # we reset at the start of the loop.
        ampline.rotate(myEuler)
        x_float = ampline.x
        y_float = ampline.y
        Verts.append((x_float, y_float, z_float))

    # makes edge keys
    for i in range(n_verts):
        if i == n_verts - 1:
            Edges.append([i, 0])
            break
        Edges.append([i, i + 1])

    out_sockets = [
        ['v', 'Verts', [Verts]],
        ['s', 'Edges', [Edges]],
    ]

    return in_sockets, out_sockets
```


### Limitations

Mostly limitations will be down to a lack of imagination or Python Skills, but if I have to mention something that surprised me it's the state of the in_socket variables when running a ui_operator function. For example if you have Verts coming into the node, like `sv_main(verts=[])` then you might expect to be able to do something with those verts from within your UI function. Unfortunately the local variables don't currently work that way, in order for you to make geometry with the UI operator, you have to generate it from inside the `sv_main()` function or access it through a somewhat roundabout way which is closer to how the regular nodes do it.

This is stupid and has to be addressed. However, until such time there is an example in the github thread that can probably be improved on.

### Future

SN iteration 1 is itself a prototype and is a testing ground for iteration 2. The intention was always to provide multiple programming language interfaces, initially coffeescript because it's a lightweight language with crazy expressive capacity. iteration 2 might work a little different, perhap working from within a class but trying to do extra introspection to reduce boilerplate.

The only reason in_sockets needs to be declared at the moment is if you want to have socket names that are different than the function arguments. It would be possible to allow `sv_main()` to take zero arguments too. So possible configurations should be:

```text

sv_main()
sv_main() + in_sockets
sv_main() + out_sockets
sv_main(a=[],..)
sv_main(a=[],..) + in_sockets
sv_main(a=[],..) + out_sockets
sv_main(a=[],..) + in_socket + out_sockets

..etc, with ui_operators optional to all combinations
```

That's it for now.
