###Description
Sverchok is a powerful parametric tool for architects, allowing geometry to be programmed visually with nodes. 
Mesh and geometry programming consists of combining basic elements such as:  

  - lists of indexed Vectors representing coordinates (Sverchok vectors are zero based)
  - lists of grouped indices to represent edges and polygons.
  - rotation angles 
  - matrices (user-friendly rotation-scale-location transformations)

Version 0.2.8 comes with more than 100 nodes to help create and manipulate geometry. Combining these nodes will allow you to:

  - do parametric constructions
  - easily change parameters with sliders and formulas
  - do cross sections
  - calculate areas
  - design material
  - use Vector fields
  - even code your own custom nodes
  - and more!
